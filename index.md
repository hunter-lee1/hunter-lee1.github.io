## About Me

My name is Shichen Li(李诗晨) and I am a first-year Ph.D student at [Soochow NLP Lab](http://nlp.suda.edu.cn/) led by [Guodong Zhou](http://nlp.suda.edu.cn/~gdzhou/index.html). I am fortunate to be supervised by [Zhongqing Wang](https://wangzqsuda.github.io/index.html) and [Peifeng Li](https://web.suda.edu.cn/pfli/). Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Wuhan University of Technology in 2021. My past research primarily focused on fine-grained social media analysis, and now my goal has expanded to understanding human communication in social contexts, with the aim of aligning language models that better support both human-to-human and human-to-computer interactions.

## Miscellaneous

I’m engaged (but an amateur) in Photography with a camera from FujiFilm! I enjoy taking street photographs, which is a great way to capture candid moments and tell stories through images. I also like to play badminton(but an amateur too)!
