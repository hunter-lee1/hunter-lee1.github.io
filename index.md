## About Me

My name is Shichen Li and I am a second-year graduate student at [Soochow NLP Lab](http://nlp.suda.edu.cn/) led by [Goudong Zhou](http://nlp.suda.edu.cn/~gdzhou/index.html). I am fortunate to be supervised by [Zhongqing Wang](https://wangzqsuda.github.io/index.html) and expect to graduate in 2024. Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Wuhan University of Technology in 2021. My main research interests focus on cross-domain sentiment analysis and aspect-based sentiment analysis.

## Miscellaneous

I’m engaged (but an amateur) in Photography with a camera from FujiFilm! I enjoy taking street photographs, which is a great way to capture candid moments and tell stories through images. I also like to play badminton(but an amateur too)!
